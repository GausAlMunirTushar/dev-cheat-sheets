# Python
## Variables
We use variables to temporarily store data in computer’s memory.
```py
price = 10
rating = 4.9
course_name = ‘Python for Beginners’
is_published = True
```
In the above example,
- price is an integer (a whole number without a decimal point)
- rating is a float (a number with a decimal point)
- course_name is a string (a sequence of characters)
- is_published is a boolean. Boolean values can be True or False. 
## Comments
We use comments to add notes to our code. Good comments explain the hows and
whys, not what the code does. That should be reflected in the code itself. Use
comments to add reminders to yourself or other developers, or also explain your
assumptions and the reasons you’ve written code in a certain way.
```py
# This is a comment and it won’t get executed.
# Our comments can be multiple lines. 
```
